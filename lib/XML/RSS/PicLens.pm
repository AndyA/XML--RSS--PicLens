=cut

our $VERSION = '0.03';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use XML::RSS::PicLens;

  my $feed = XML::RSS::PicLens->new;
  $feed->add_image(
    link      => 'foo.jpg',
    image     => 'foo.jpg',
    thumbnail => 'thumbs/foo.jpg',
    title     => 'An bootiful foo'
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PicLens is an immersive media browser that can be launched directly from
a web browser when visiting a supported site. It uses RSS autodiscovery
to locate an RSS feed describing the available media. This module
provides a simple interface for generating such a feed.

See L<http://piclens.com/lite/webmasterguide.php> for more information.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 C<< new >>

Create a new C<XML::RSS::PicLens> object. C<XML::RSS::PicLens> is a
subclass of L<XML::RSS>; any arguments to C<new> are passed to the
superclass's constructor. The RSS version defaults to 2.0.

=cut

sub new {
  my $class = shift;
  my $self = $class->SUPER::new( version => '2.0', @_ );

  $self->add_module(
    prefix => 'media',
    uri    => 'http://search.yahoo.com/mrss'
  );

  return $self;
}

=head2 C<< add_image >>

Add an image to the feed.

    $feed->add_image(
        link      => 'foo.jpg',
        image     => 'foo.jpg',
        thumbnail => 'thumbs/foo.jpg',
        title     => 'An bootiful foo'
    );

At least one of C<image>, C<thumbnail> must be supplied. Optionally you
may supply C<link> and C<title>. If these are omitted they will default
to values based on C<image> or C<thumbnail>.

=cut

sub add_image {
  my $self = shift;
  croak "add_image must be called as a method"
   unless ref $self;
  croak "add_image needs a number of key => value pairs"
   if @_ % 1;
  my %args = @_;

  my $image     = delete $args{image};
  my $thumbnail = delete $args{thumbnail};

  croak "add_image needs at least one of image, thumbnail"
   unless defined $image
     or defined $thumbnail;

  my $default = defined $image ? $image : $thumbnail;

  my $link  = delete $args{link};
  my $title = delete $args{title};

  $link = $default unless defined $link;
  ( $title = $default ) =~ s!.*/!! unless defined $title;

  $self->add_item(
    title => $title,
    link  => $link,
    media => {
      (
        defined $thumbnail
        ? ( thumbnail => { url => $thumbnail } )
        : ()
      ),
      ( defined $image ? ( content => { url => $image } ) : () ),
    },
  );
}
